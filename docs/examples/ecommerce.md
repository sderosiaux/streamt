# E-commerce Events

Track user behavior in real-time for personalization, recommendations, and analytics.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[clickstream] --> B[events_clean]
    C[products] --> D[events_enriched]
    B --> D
    D --> E[user_sessions]
    D --> F[product_popularity]
    E --> G[Personalization API]
    F --> H[Recommendations]
```

## Use Cases

- **Session Analytics**: Track user journeys in real-time
- **Product Popularity**: Real-time trending products
- **Personalization**: Feed ML models with user behavior
- **A/B Testing**: Measure feature impact live
